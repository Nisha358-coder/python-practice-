Python Practice

- This repository contains my Python practice work as I learn and revise core programming concepts.
I use this repo to build logic, understand fundamentals, and apply concepts through small programs.

What’s Inside

- Practice problems using for loops and while loops

- Number-based logic problems (digits, palindrome, Harshad, strong number)

- Small mini programs built using loops and conditions

Purpose

- Strengthen Python fundamentals

- Improve problem-solving skills

- Maintain consistent learning and practice

This repository will grow as I continue learning Python.
